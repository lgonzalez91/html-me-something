            <h2>What is makes a road bike?</h2>
            <a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ri-z.html#road">Sheldon Brown gives a general definition of a road bike.</a>
                <p>But if I were to define a road bike, it is a bike with "aggressive" geometry that is made with intention to ride on the road, or as Sheldon calls it, a sport bike.<br> Think the difference between a regular 4-door car and a sport car.</h4></p>

            <h2>What makes a mountain bike?</h2>
            <p><a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_m.html#mountainbike">If you follow this link, you'll notice I like referencing this guy.<a></p>
                <p>The general "off-road" definition is a little generous, as you'll see with cyclocross, so I would define a modern mountain as a bike designed<br> with the intention of handling any type of terrain more extreme than your regular bike trail. Think the difference between walking around<br> Forest Park and walking up a mountain.</p>

            <h2>What makes a fixed gear/track bike?</h2>
                <a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_e-f.html#fixed">Track bikes technically fall under fixed gear bikes.</a></br>
                However, Track racing and "Fixie" bikes encompass two very different disciplines.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UafA2541c4">Olympic level track racing</a></li><br>
                    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTb5RbAmjgo">Fixie punks being fixie punks.</a></li>
                </ul>
                If those videos didn't help explain the difference, track cycling is about competition while fixie riding is about streetcred.

            <h2>What in the world in cyclocross?</h2>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNjWeATyylc">Cyclocross is pain. Cyclocross is love. Cyclocross is life.</a><br>
            Cyclocross is a cycling discipline that is very old, but is seeing a resurgance in popularity within the last decade.<br>
